# Contributing to `kubernetes-scanner`

## Proposing Changes

We're happy to have you contributing code to `kubernetes-scanner`! However,
please open an issue to discuss your proposed changes first.

For simple bug fixes feel free to open a PR directly.

Additionally, please have a read through our [Architecture
Document](./docs/architecture.md).

## Commits

This repository uses [conventional-commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
style messages to support automated SemVer releases. Your commit messages will
get linted once we approve the CI workflow.

Additionally, if you have a larger PR, please break them up into small,
independent and reviewable commits. We know that this is not always possible, so
use your own judgement on this.

## Opening a PR

Once you're happy with your changes, please open a PR in this repository and we
will have a look at it as soon as possible. We will also trigger CI workflows
once we have verified your changes. We'll review your changes and once
everything is done, we will merge your PR onto `main`, which will automatically
trigger a new release.
