config:
  # MANDATORY: clusterName is a friendly name for the cluster that this agent is
  # running on. For example "prod-us" or "dev-eu".
  # If installing scanners to multiple clusters, please configure a different
  # cluster name for each cluster. These do not need to be globally unique, as
  # they are scoped by organization, but using clashing cluster names within an
  # organization may make it difficult for users to associate issues with specific
  # clusters later.
  #
  # clusterName: "default"

  # MANDATORY: set routes
  # Routes define which resources should be sent to which organizations.
  # It is required to provide at least one valid route to agent to be able to start
  # When using organization level service accounts, service account is authorized
  # to route data only for the organization it is created in.
  # When using group level service accounts, service account can route data to
  # all organizations under the created group.
  # This allows having a single installation of the kubernetes-scanner in a
  # cluster used by multiple organizations.
  #
  # Each route contains
  # * organizationID: Target organizationID for the resources
  # * clusterScopedResources: true if cluster resources should be routed for this organization
  # * namespaces: a list of namespaces. If * wildcard is used,
  # resources from all namespaces will be routed to organization
  #
  # An example routing configuration which will route
  # * All cluster resources and resources from all namespaces
  # to organization aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaa
  # * All resources from test-cluster-f and prod-cluster-f namespaces
  # to organization ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-fffffffffffff
